# MAGPIE: A Multilevel-Adaptive-Guided Solver for Ptychographic Phase Retrieval 

This repository contains the implementation of the main algorithms described in the paper: 
**“MAGPIE: A Multilevel-Adaptive-Guided Solver for Ptychographic Phase Retrieval.”** The paper is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10118). authored by [Borong Zhang](https://borongzhang.com/), [Qin Li](https://sites.google.com/view/qinlimadison/home), and [Zichao (Wendy) Di](https://www.anl.gov/profile/zichao-di). 

The algorithm is built in Python and leverages NumPy, SciPy, and Jupyter for development and visualization.
